# Magikatana
An opensource tech-demo, mixing Ghost Runner and Devil May Cry together in a fast paced, first person melee combat. Designed to test my skills as a game developer, specifically as Gameplay Engineer.

Developed by Bruno Peres ([@tldmbruno](https://www.linkedin.com/in/tldmbruno/)), using the Unreal Engine 4.27.

I'm using this project as an opportunity to hone my development skills, to learn Unreal Engine (as my forth game engine) and C++, to use it as a portfolio, and to get the tools and the code already done for a future project of mine (which will take use of the same combat and movement mechanics). Unfortunately, as the time of writing (October 27th 2023), the Magikatana Project is a single person project, and I know one of the best work experiences comes through communication between team members.
